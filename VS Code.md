# **Visual studio Code**

>Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.

### **Features**

>+ **Code Handle**
>>- _One of the most awesome things about VS Code is not actually a feature of the editor itself. VS Code was launched during //BUILD 2015 with an accompanying @code Twitter handle – how cool is that?! Let us leave it to your imagination on how Microsoft pulled off securing that awesome social brand._

>+ **Huge Language Support**

>>- _Not only is VS Code available cross-platform, it aims to be your one-stop code editor with support for 30+ programming languages out-of-the-box. Which ones you ask? You get to write C#, VB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Ruby, Objective-C, PHP, JSON, Less, Sass and Markdown, just to name a few. You get built-in syntax highlighting and bracket matching in your code, as well as easy code navigation. VS Code aims to be a first class IDE of choice for Node.js, ASP.NET and TypeScript development, aimed at modern web/cloud applications._


>+ **Side-by-Side Editing**

>>- _VS Code supports one of the most sought-after developer requests – editing code side by side. Simply Command (⌘) / Control click on a file from your project explorer and, voila, multiple files open up side by side, pre-docked and ready for edits. VS Code can support up to three simultaneous file edits, each of which can be launched from the command prompt as well. The screenshot below shows two files from an ASP.NET project being open for edits side by side – life is good._



>+ **Always-On IntelliSense**

>>- _You wouldn’t want to be writing .NET code without the comforts of Visual Studio IntelliSense, right? VS Code knows this and tries to please with out-of-the-box IntelliSense. Sure you get friendly prompts on language features, but also smart IntelliSense that is local context aware in your custom code, as demonstrated below:_

 >+  **Command Palette**

>>- _One of the powerful utilities of VS Code that you may want to keep handy is the Command Palette – simply hit Command/Control+Shift+P (⇧⌘P) to bring it up. Think of it as PowerShell inside your IDE, ready to serve up commonly used tasks with a shortcut, as the below screenshot demonstrates._


### **Useful Plugins**

>+ **Auto close Tag**

>>- _Automatically add closing tag when you type in the closing bracket of the opening tag.After closing tag is inserted, the cursor is between the opening and closing tag
Set the tag list that would not be auto closed._

>+ **Auto import** 

>>- **filesToScan** - _Glob for which files in your workspace to scan, defaults to '*/.{ts, tsx}'_
>>- **showNotifications** - _Controls if the annoying notifications should be shown, defaults to false._

>+ **Auto Rename Tag**

>>- _Add entry into auto-rename-tag.activationOnLanguage to set the languages that the extension will be activated. By default, it is ["*"] and will be activated for all languages._

>+ **Code spell Checker**

>>- _A basic spell checker that works well with camelCase code.
The goal of this spell checker is to help with catching common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low._

>+ **Docker**

>>- _Automatic Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and .dockerignore file generation (Press F1 and search for Docker: Add Docker files to Workspace)
Syntax highlighting, hover tips, IntelliSense (completions) for docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile files
Linting (errors and warnings) for Dockerfile files._

>+ **HTML Snippets**

_This extension adds rich language support for the HTML Markup to VS Code, including:_

>>- _Full HTML5 Tags_
>>- _Colorization_
>>- _Snippets_
>>- _[partially implemented] Quick Info_
>>- _description mentions if tag deprecated_

>+ **HTML CSS Support**

>>- _Class attribute completion.
Id attribute completion.
Supports Zen Coding completion for class and id attributes.
Scans workspace folder for css and scss files.
Supports remote css files._

>+ **Terminal**

>>- _I have another extension: Code Runner which is superset of the Terminal extension since it not only supports powershell, bat/cmd, bash/sh but also supports other script language like js, php, python, perl, ruby, go, lua, groovy, vbscript even F#, C#. Moreover, this Code Runner extension has more functions (e.g. working directory support, output syntax highlight, run as a file instead of running a set of commands and so on) and will have more supports and updates in the future._
